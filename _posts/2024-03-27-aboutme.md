I am Srinivas, Just a speck in the pale blue dot trying to make sense of everything happening out there. Thriving in the sea of cosmic chaos and indifference. Trying to build artificially semi-intelligent computational beings that can dream and model real world and existence, and oh! can also just say if its a cat or a dog.
