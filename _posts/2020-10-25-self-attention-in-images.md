# The New World Order : Transformers for Images

### CNNs, The first class citizens of the Imaging world and their evolution
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been at the heart of spectacular advances in deep learning. Although CNNs have been used as early as the nineties to solve character recognition tasks (Le Cun et al., 1997), their current widespread application is due to much more recent work, when a deep CNN was used to beat state-of-the-art in the ImageNet image classification challenge (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Before going deep inside the Transformers part we need to underst
