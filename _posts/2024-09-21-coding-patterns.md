## Why gawk at patterns for algorithms ?
Patterns are important. Patterns let you understand, organize, deconstruct, dissect a complex coding problem into building block of patterns and helps you solve them. We are going to checkout most common patterns and where and how they are solved and probably going to see more advanced combinations of multiple patterns. We are going to start with simple easy problems to checkout with reference to leetcode problems and how to solve them and eventually try to reach god level problems with analysing algorithms from papers and try to break them down. We are going to implement these in C++, dont ask me why. 

## Pattern 1 :: Two Pointers
These patterns involve traversing sequential
